Song Storage Documentation
=========================

Introduction
------------

The Song Storage GUI is a Python application that provides a graphical interface for managing and organizing a collection of songs. The application uses the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and interacts with a SQLite database to store information about each song, including its file path, artist, song name, release date, and tags. The application also leverages the pygame library to play audio files.

Code Layout
-----------

The code adheres to consistent indentation, spaces around operators, and other formatting guidelines, maintaining a clean and readable structure. Ensure that any future modifications maintain this consistent formatting.

Naming Conventions
------------------

Descriptive names are used for variables, functions, and classes, following the recommended naming style, such as lower_case_with_underscores for variables. This enhances code readability and understanding.

Comments
--------

Clear and concise comments are provided throughout the code to explain complex sections. Commenting is especially useful for understanding the purpose and functionality of methods, ensuring that readers can comprehend the code easily.

Docstrings
----------

Docstrings are used to describe the purpose, parameters, and return types of functions and classes. This documentation style adheres to PEP conventions, aiding developers in understanding the usage and behavior of each component.
